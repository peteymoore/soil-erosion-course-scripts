# soil-erosion-course-scripts
A group of stand-alone MATLAB scripts to simulate infiltration, runoff and erosion processes. Developed for teaching purposes.

**Currently contains**:

Green_Ampt_1.m: A zero-D solver for infiltration as a function of time. Inputs are soil hydraulic properties, initial saturation, and a storm hyetograph.

KW_overland_2.m: A 1D hillslope runoff solver using the kinematic wave approximation using the formulation of Huang and Li, 2013, Journal of Hydrology, v. 489:238-245. 

1D_erosion.m: coming soon.
